      " Umamusume: Pretty Derby is a Japanese multimedia franchise created by Cygames. The franchise centers on anthropomorphised racehorses known as Umamusume (ウマ娘; lit. 'horse girls'), who compete in races inspired by real-life race tracks managed by the Japan Racing Association. Most characters are named after and modeled on actual racehorses, reflecting their namesakes' personalities, racing records, and relationships with other racehorses. Initially announced in 2016 as a mobile game, the project soon expanded to include multiple anime series, manga, and live concerts. \n",
      "The game was scheduled to debut in late 2018 for iOS and Android devices, but it was delayed to a February 2021 release, with a Windows client releasing a month later on DMM Games, then later on Google Play Games in April 2023. It would later be available in Korean by Kakao Games and Traditional Chinese by Komoe Game in June 2022, with the former language getting a PC version in a stand-alone client a year later, then later in Simplified Chinese by Bilibili in August 2024. An English-language edition was released worldwide in June 2025 for the aforementioned platforms, alongside a Steam release for both the Japanese and English versions, with the latter language being exclusively available on that platform.\n",
      "An anime television series adaptation produced by P.A. Works aired from April to June 2018. A second season now produced by Studio Kai, with the former studio assisting in its production, aired from January to March 2021. A third season produced solely by Studio Kai aired from October to December 2023. \n",
      "Alongside the main anime series, multiple anime spin-offs have been made. An anime television series adaptation of the manga Umayon aired from July to September 2020. Its sequel, titled Umayuru, premiered in October 2022. A web anime produced by Cygames' in-house animation studio CygamesPictures titled Umamusume Pretty Derby: Road to the Top aired from April to May 2023. An anime film also produced by CygamesPictures titled Umamusume Pretty Derby: Beginning of a New Era premiered in Japan in May 2024. An anime television series adaptation of Umamusume: Cinderella Gray produced by CygamesPictures premiered in April 2025, with a short web spinoff anime titled Umayuru: Pretty Gray premiering that same month.  \n",

      "== Gameplay ==\n",
      "Umamusume: Pretty Derby is a sports simulation game that allows players, who are referred in-game as \"trainers\", to nurture a horse girl's abilities and win various races. Players are able to use the game's gacha system to obtain two types of units: \"trainees\", who are the playable horse girls, and \"support cards\", which help a trainee by offering skills and abilities.\n",
      "The game's main mode is referred to as the \"Career\" mode, which allows the player to pick a trainee of their choice, choose the support cards that can benefit the trainee, and make them achieve a set list of goals catered to the chosen trainee. The gameplay loop is centered on a calendar system where every action the player makes accounts for one turn corresponding to half a month in a Japanese schoolyear, prompting the player to strategically plan their moves ahead of time before reaching a certain goal.\n",
      "During the Career mode, players allot their turns to either train their trainee and raise their statistics, allow them to rest or engage in recreation, or participate in races to gain more skill points to purchase skills and reach fan milestones. Players must also give attention to the trainee's mood, which functions as a multiplier and grants bonuses during training.\n",
      "Allotting a turn to training gives the player a further five options to choose to enhance a trainee during a race: speed, which dictates how fast they can run; stamina, which dictates how long they can maintain their run; power, which affects their acceleration and positioning; guts, which can offer additional stamina for them near the end of a race; and wit, which helps them in activating skills. Players are enc....\n",

Park also felt the challenges from the MAPPA's staff in adapting the series' designs, build the characters, and create the \"Domain Expansion\" scenes during their production which he stated that it required a lots of detailed discussion with Akutami and Shueisha to enhance their works. Compared to his previous work The God of High School, Park acknowledges in working with different teams through the use of their technique and creativity to make their action scenes possible.\n",
      "Scriptwriter Hiroshi Seko discussed about the handling of the drama but also the comedic banter between the teenagers, adults, and the cursed spirits in the series which is mostly based on the original materials. Toho producer Hiroaki Matsutani also revealed the addition of the post-credits shorts \"Juju Sanpo\", in which an idea from Akutami came up with the draft and later submitting it to the staff. When discussing about the sound and music, Matsutani originally stated that they assigned Yoshiki Kobayashi as the composer, before its role was eventually given to both Hiroaki Tsutsumi and Yoshimasa Terui.\n",
