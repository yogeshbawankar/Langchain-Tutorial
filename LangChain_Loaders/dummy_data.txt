On a field of green, beneath the sun,
A timeless battle is begun.
With willow bat and leather ball,
The players stand, prepared to give their all.

The bowler starts his rhythmic pace,
With focused mind and steely grace.
The ball released, a crimson streak,
A silent challenge, so to speak.
It swings and seams through summer air,
A test of skill beyond compare.

The batsman waits, with steady eye,
As leather lightning hurtles by.
A flash of wood, a perfect drive,
Keeping the thrilling chase alive.
The ball speeds off across the ground,
Without a whisper, not a sound.

A mighty heave, a soaring shot,
The fielderâ€™s desperate chase is for naught.
It clears the rope, a glorious six,
A magic moment in the mix.
The crowd erupts, a joyful roar,
And adds the runs up to the score.

But fortunes change with sudden dread,
A perfect yorker, straight and dead.
The stumps are rattled, bails alight,
Ending the batsman's valiant fight.
It's triumph here and sorrow there,
An epic drama, rich and rare.
