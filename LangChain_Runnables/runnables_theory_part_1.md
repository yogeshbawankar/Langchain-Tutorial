## The Challenge with Legacy "Chains"

Previously, building applications with LangChain involved using numerous custom "Chains" with disparate interfaces. Different components had unique methods, such as `predict` or `format`, which created a steep learning curve and a ballooning codebase. This lack of a unified approach made it difficult to compose components flexibly and efficiently.

## The Runnable Protocol: A Standardized Interface

Runnables solve this problem by enforcing a **common, standardized interface** across all LangChain components. The primary method in this interface is `invoke`. This standardization means that any Runnable can connect seamlessly with another, allowing the output of one component to automatically serve as the input for the next. This "Lego block" approach enables the creation of highly flexible and arbitrarily complex multi-step workflows, overcoming the rigidity of earlier Chain implementations.

> üìå **Note:** Always use the `invoke` method when interacting with LangChain components. Older, component-specific methods are being deprecated in favor of this standardized approach.

## Why Runnables are the Foundation of LangChain

A deep understanding of the Runnable protocol is **essential for any AI engineer** working with LangChain. Runnables are not just a feature; they are the underlying mechanism that empowers all modern "Chains". Mastering them simplifies the development of sophisticated LLM-based applications and provides a fundamental grasp of how the entire framework operates.

## Actionable Steps for Developers

Here‚Äôs how you can effectively integrate Runnables into your workflow:

* üß† **Prioritize Learning Runnables**: Dedicate focused effort to understanding the Runnable protocol. This will give you a deeper, more fundamental grasp of the LangChain framework.
* üîó **Utilize Standardized Composition**: When building LLM applications, leverage the standardized Runnable components for flexible workflow composition instead of crafting custom, rigid "Chain" logic.
* üó£Ô∏è **Provide Feedback**: Viewers are encouraged to watch the entire video this summary is based on and offer feedback to the creator regarding its quality and clarity.

## Key Takeaways

* **Standardized Interface**: Runnables introduced a common interface, primarily the `invoke` method, to standardize interactions across all LangChain components, simplifying a previously complex and inconsistent system.
* **Seamless Chaining & Flexibility**: The uniform nature of Runnables allows for effortless composition, enabling developers to build flexible, multi-step workflows by connecting components like building blocks.
* **Core LangChain Foundation**: Understanding Runnables is crucial as they are the core mechanism that powers modern "Chains" and simplifies the creation of advanced LLM applications.
