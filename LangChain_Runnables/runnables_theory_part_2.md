# A Deep Dive into LangChain Runnable Primitives and LCEL

*This guide details how LangChain addressed the initial problem of disparate, non-standardized components by introducing Runnables. Runnables standardize these components, enabling seamless connection and the creation of flexible AI workflows. We'll categorize Runnables, explore the core Primitives used for orchestration, and introduce the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for simplified chain definition.*

## The Problem: A Lack of Standardization

In its early stages, LangChain components like `PromptTemplate`, LLMs, Parsers, and Retrievers were not standardized. Each had a different method for interaction‚Äî`format` for prompts, `predict` for LLMs, `parse` for parsers, and `get_relevant_document` for retrievers. This inconsistency made it difficult to connect components and build flexible, cohesive workflows.

---

## The Solution: The Runnable Protocol

To solve this, LangChain introduced the **Runnable** protocol to standardize all components. This was achieved by:
1.  Implementing a universal `invoke` function for interaction across all components.
2.  Creating an abstract `Runnable` class that all component classes inherit, forcing the implementation of `invoke` and other standard methods.

This standardization allows any component to be easily connected, as the output of one automatically becomes the input for the next, enabling seamless composition.

## Categorizing LangChain Runnables

Runnables in LangChain can be divided into two main categories.

### Task-Specific Runnables
These are the core LangChain components (`PromptTemplate`, `ChatOpenAI`, `Retriever`, Parsers) that have been converted into Runnables. Each serves a specific purpose, such as designing prompts or interacting with an LLM, and they are designed to be used effectively within pipelines.

### Runnable Primitives
These are the fundamental building blocks that help orchestrate and connect Task-Specific Runnables. Their purpose is to define execution logic, enabling the creation of complex workflows by specifying how different Runnables interact‚Äîsequentially, in parallel, or conditionally. Examples include `RunnableSequence`, `RunnableParallel`, and `RunnableBranch`.

## Exploring the Core Runnable Primitives

This guide focuses on the essential primitives that form the backbone of chain orchestration.

### RunnableSequence
- **Purpose**: To connect two or more Runnables in a sequential manner.
- **Mechanism**: The output of the first Runnable automatically serves as the input for the subsequent one. There is no limit to the number of Runnables that can be chained together.
- **Example**: Creating a chain to first generate a joke and then generate an explanation for that joke: `PromptTemplate` -> `ChatOpenAI` -> `StringOutputParser` -> `PromptTemplate` -> `ChatOpenAI` -> `StringOutputParser`.

### RunnableParallel
- **Purpose**: To enable the parallel execution of multiple Runnables.
- **Mechanism**: Each parallel Runnable receives the same input and processes it independently. The combined results are returned as a dictionary of outputs.
- **Example**: Taking a single topic like "AI" and simultaneously generating a tweet with one LLM path and a LinkedIn post with another. The output would be a dictionary: `{"tweet": "...", "linkedin": "..."}`.

### RunnablePassThrough
- **Purpose**: A unique primitive that returns its input unchanged, without any processing.
- **Use Case**: It is useful when the original input needs to be preserved or passed along while other parallel processes generate new outputs.
- **Example**: In the joke generation and explanation scenario, it can be used in a parallel branch to ensure the original joke is included in the final output dictionary alongside its explanation.

### RunnableLambda
- **Purpose**: To convert any standard Python function into a Runnable.
- **Benefit**: This allows custom Python logic or pre-processing steps (e.g., text cleaning, word counting) to be seamlessly integrated into a LangChain chain.
- **Example**: Integrating a `word_counter` function into a workflow to return both a generated joke and its word count in the final output.

### RunnableBranch
- **Purpose**: To create conditional chains, acting as an "if-else" statement within workflows.
- **Mechanism**: It takes pairs of conditions (often lambda functions) and corresponding Runnables. Based on which condition evaluates to true, the associated Runnable is executed. A default path can be provided to act as the "else" case.
- **Example**: A workflow that checks the word count of a report. If it exceeds 500 words, the report is sent to an LLM for summarization; otherwise, the original report is passed through as-is.

## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)

Observing that `RunnableSequence` is the most frequently used primitive, LangChain introduced **LCEL** to simplify its syntax.

- **Syntax**: LCEL replaces the verbose `RunnableSequence([R1, R2, R3])` with a more declarative and intuitive syntax using the pipe (`|`) operator: `R1 | R2 | R3`.
- **Scope**: While currently focused on sequential chains, it is anticipated that LCEL will expand to include declarative syntax for other primitives like `RunnableParallel` and `RunnableBranch` in the future.

> üí° **Tip:** Moving forward, the pipe operator (`|`) is the preferred method for building sequential chains in LangChain due to its clarity and conciseness.

## Key Terminology

**Runnables**
: Standardized components in LangChain designed to enable seamless connection and flexible composition.

**Task-Specific Runnables**
: Core LangChain components (e.g., `PromptTemplate`, `LLM`, `Parser`) converted into Runnables.

**Runnable Primitives**
: Fundamental building blocks that facilitate the orchestration of Task-Specific Runnables (e.g., `RunnableSequence`, `RunnableParallel`).

**Invoke Function**
: The universal, standardized function used to interact with all Runnables.

**RunnableSequence**
: A primitive that connects multiple Runnables in a sequential order.

**RunnableParallel**
: A primitive that enables the simultaneous execution of multiple Runnables.

**RunnablePassThrough**
: A primitive that returns its input exactly as output, without modification.

**RunnableLambda**
: A primitive that converts any standard Python function into a Runnable.

**RunnableBranch**
: A primitive for implementing "if-else" conditional logic within chains.

**LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**
: A declarative syntax using the pipe (`|`) operator to simplify the definition of sequential chains.
