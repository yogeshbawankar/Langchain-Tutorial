## Understanding LLM Outputs

Large Language Models can produce outputs in two primary forms: unstructured and structured. Understanding the difference is crucial for building robust applications.

### Unstructured Output
When you interact with a chatbot like ChatGPT, you typically receive a natural language response. This free-form text is considered **unstructured output**.

* **Example**: Asking "What is the capital of India?" yields the text "New Delhi is the capital of India."
* **Limitation**: While human-readable, this format is difficult for machines to parse reliably. Integrating this raw text with other systems, such as databases or APIs, requires complex and often brittle parsing logic.

### Structured Output
**Structured output** forces an LLM to return data in a predefined format, most commonly JSON. This ensures the model's response is predictable, consistent, and machine-readable.

* **Example**: Instead of a plain-text travel plan, an LLM can return a JSON object where each step is a dictionary with `time` and `activity` keys.
* **Benefit**: Structured data is easily parsed and used programmatically. This capability allows LLMs to communicate seamlessly with external tools, databases, and APIs, forming the backbone of advanced applications like AI agents.

## Key Use Cases for Structured Output

Forcing a predictable structure unlocks powerful capabilities for developers.

### Data Extraction
Structured output is ideal for extracting specific information from unstructured text. For a job portal, you could feed an LLM a candidate's resume and have it return a JSON object containing their name, previous company, and academic qualifications, ready to be inserted into a database.

### API Development
When building an API that leverages an LLM, structured output is essential. For instance, an API for summarizing product reviews could process a long, user-written review and return a structured object detailing the topics discussed, pros, cons, and overall sentiment. This clean data can then be served efficiently to any application.

### Building Autonomous Agents
Agents are advanced systems that can perform tasks by using a suite of "tools." These tools, such as a calculator or a weather API, require specific, structured inputs (e.g., numbers for calculations). Structured output allows an agent to interpret a user's natural language request (e.g., "What is the square root of 2?"), extract the necessary information ("2"), and pass it to the correct tool in the required format.

## Achieving Structured Output in LangChain

LangChain provides two primary mechanisms for generating structured output:

1.  **Native Support**: Modern models, like OpenAI's GPT series, are trained to generate structured data. For these, LangChain provides the `.with_structured_output()` function to specify the desired format.
2.  **Output Parsers**: For older or less capable models, LangChain offers **Output Parsers**. These are helper classes that take the model's unstructured text output and attempt to parse it into a structured format.

> üìå **Note:** This guide focuses on the `.with_structured_output()` method. Output Parsers will be covered in a future document.

### Defining Your Data Schema
To use `.with_structured_output()`, you must first define the data schema you want the model to return. LangChain supports three methods for this.

#### 1. TypedDict
A standard Python feature (`from typing import TypedDict`) that lets you define the keys and value types for a dictionary.

* **How it Works**: You define a class inheriting from `TypedDict`, specifying attributes and their types (e.g., `Name: str`, `Age: int`).
* **Benefit**: Provides static type hints for your code editor, which improves code clarity and aids team collaboration.
* **Limitation**: `TypedDict` offers no runtime data validation. Your code will execute even if the LLM returns data that doesn't match the specified types.
* **Best For**: Python-only projects where you only need type hints for development and don't require strict data validation.

#### 2. Pydantic
Pydantic is a powerful Python library for data validation and parsing. It is the most common and recommended method for defining data structures in LangChain.

* **How it Works**: You define a class inheriting from Pydantic's `BaseModel`, which looks similar to `TypedDict`.
* **Advantages**:
    * **Data Validation**: Pydantic strictly enforces type correctness at runtime and raises errors if the data is invalid.
    * **Type Coercion**: It automatically converts data where possible (e.g., the string `"32"` becomes the integer `32`).
    * **Advanced Features**: Supports default values, optional fields, and powerful built-in validators for common types like emails (`EmailStr`). The `Field` function allows for complex validation rules, such as value ranges and regex patterns.
* **Output**: The LLM returns a Pydantic object, which can be easily converted to a dictionary (`.dict()`) or JSON (`.json()`).

> üí° **Tip:** Use Pydantic whenever you need data validation, default values, or type coercion. It is the industry standard for building reliable, data-driven applications in Python.

#### 3. JSON Schema
JSON Schema is a language-agnostic standard for defining the structure of JSON data.

* **How it Works**: You define the schema directly as a JSON object, specifying properties, types, and required fields.
* **Output**: The LLM returns a standard Python dictionary that conforms to the schema.
* **Best For**: Multi-language projects (e.g., Python backend, JavaScript frontend) where a single, universal data schema needs to be shared across services.

---

### The `method` Parameter
The `.with_structured_output()` function includes an optional `method` parameter to control how the LLM generates the structured data.

* `json_mode`: Instructs the model to return a JSON object. This is suitable for models like Claude and Gemini that have a dedicated JSON mode.
* `function_calling`: Instructs the model to format its output as if it were calling a function with specific arguments. This is the default method for OpenAI models and is essential for building agents that use tools.

## Model Compatibility

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Not all models support structured output generation. Many open-source models, such as TinyLlama, may not work with `json_mode` or `function_calling`. In these cases, you must rely on LangChain's **Output Parsers** to process the model's raw text output into a structured format.

## Key Takeaways

* **Unstructured output** is human-readable text, while **structured output** is machine-readable data (like JSON).
* Structured output is essential for reliable **data extraction**, building **APIs**, and creating autonomous **agents**.
* LangChain's `.with_structured_output()` method forces capable models to return structured data.
* You can define your desired data schema using Python's **`TypedDict`**, **Pydantic**, or the universal **JSON Schema** standard.
* **Pydantic is the recommended approach** in most Python projects due to its powerful data validation features.
* Always check your model's documentation for compatibility with structured output methods like `json_mode` or `function_calling`.
