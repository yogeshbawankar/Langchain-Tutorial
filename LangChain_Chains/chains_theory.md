## Introduction to Chains and Their Necessity

Chains are a core and highly important component in LangChain, so much so that the framework is named after them. They are critical for building LLM-based applications, which inherently consist of multiple small steps.

Building multi-step applications manually involves significant effort, such as designing prompts, invoking LLMs, and processing outputs separately. This becomes cumbersome for large and complex applications. Chains provide a solution by creating pipelines that connect these smaller steps, automating the flow of data. The output of one step automatically becomes the input for the next, eliminating the need for manual handling of intermediate results.

Beyond simple sequential pipelines, Chains support various structures, including **parallel processing** (executing multiple chains simultaneously) and **conditional processing** (executing different chains based on conditions). This guide focuses on the fundamentals and practical construction of these chains.

> 📌 **Note:** While this document covers the practical application of building chains, a deeper dive into the underlying "Runnable" concept and its internal workings is essential for advanced development.

## Building Sequential Chains

Sequential chains execute a series of steps in a linear order, where the output of one step is the input for the next.

#### Simple Sequential Chain Example (Generate Five Facts)

A basic application might take a topic from a user and generate five interesting facts about it.

* **Components Used**: `PromptTemplate` (for prompt design), `ChatOpenAI` (as the LLM), and `StringOutputParser` (for consistent string output).
* **Construction using LCEL**: Components are joined using the pipe operator (`|`), which is part of the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).
    ```python
    chain = prompt | model | parser
    ```
* **Execution**: Only the first step requires explicit input; the chain automatically triggers subsequent steps. The chain is invoked using `chain.invoke({"topic": "Cricket"})`.
* **Visualization**: The flow of a chain can be visualized using `chain.get_graph().print_ascii()` to better understand its structure.

#### More Complex Sequential Chain Example (Detailed Report and Summary)

A more advanced application could get a topic, generate a detailed report, and then summarize that report into five key points. This involves two sequential LLM calls.

* **Components**: Two `PromptTemplate` objects (`prompt_one` for the report, `prompt_two` for the summary), one `ChatOpenAI` model, and one `StringOutputParser`.
* **Chain Construction**: The output of the first LLM call (the detailed report) becomes the input for the second prompt (for summarization).
    ```python
    chain = prompt_one | model | parser | prompt_two | model | parser
    ```
This demonstrates how arbitrarily long sequential chains can be constructed to handle complex, multi-step tasks.

## Building Parallel Chains

Parallel chains allow for the concurrent execution of multiple processes, which is useful for tasks like generating different types of content from the same input.

#### Application Example: Notes and Quiz Generation

Given a detailed text, an application could simultaneously generate notes and a quiz, then merge these two outputs into a single document. The input text is sent to two separate LLM processes in parallel, and their combined outputs are then sent to a third LLM for merging.

* **Key Component**: `RunnableParallel`, which allows multiple chains to be executed in parallel.

##### Steps for Construction:

1.  **Define Prompts**: Create separate `PromptTemplate` objects for notes (`prompt_one`), the quiz (`prompt_two`), and merging (`prompt_three`).
2.  **Initialize Models**: Instantiate two different LLM models (e.g., `ChatOpenAI` and `ChatAnthropic`'s Claude 3) to showcase flexibility.
3.  **Create Individual Chains**:
    * `notes_chain = prompt_one | model_one | parser`
    * `quiz_chain = prompt_two | model_two | parser`
4.  **Combine in Parallel**: Use `RunnableParallel` to create a dictionary that maps names to their respective chains.
    ```python
    parallel_chain = RunnableParallel({"notes": notes_chain, "quiz": quiz_chain})
    ```
5.  **Create Merging Chain**: This is a sequential chain that takes the output of the parallel step.
    ```python
    merge_chain = prompt_three | model_one | parser
    ```
6.  **Form Final Chain**: Connect the `parallel_chain` to the `merge_chain`.
    ```python
    final_chain = parallel_chain | merge_chain
    ```
7.  **Invoke**: Call `final_chain.invoke()` with the initial large text to execute the entire workflow.

## Building Conditional Chains

Conditional chains implement "if-else" logic, allowing different execution paths based on specific criteria. This enables the creation of dynamic and responsive applications.

#### Application Example: Sentiment-Based Feedback Response

An application could take user product feedback, classify its sentiment as positive or negative, and then generate a specific response tailored to that sentiment.

* **Key Component**: `RunnableBranch`, which enables conditional logic by executing only one of several chains based on conditions.

> ⚠️ **Challenge:** LLMs can produce inconsistent outputs (e.g., returning "The sentiment is positive" instead of just "Positive"). This can break conditional logic.

To address this, the `PydanticOutputParser` is used to enforce a strict output structure.

##### Steps for Construction:

1.  **Define a Pydantic Model**: Create a `Pydantic` `BaseModel` (e.g., `Feedback`) with a `Literal` type for the sentiment field to restrict the output to either "Positive" or "Negative".
2.  **Use PydanticOutputParser**: The parser ensures the LLM's output adheres to the defined Pydantic object. Instructions from the parser (`parser_two.get_format_instructions()`) are passed to the `PromptTemplate` to guide the LLM.
3.  **Build the Classification Chain**:
    ```python
    classification_chain = prompt_one | model | parser_two
    ```
4.  **Create Branch Chains**: Define separate prompts and chains for positive (`prompt_two`) and negative (`prompt_three`) replies.
5.  **Build the `RunnableBranch`**: The branch is constructed with a series of tuples, each containing a condition (as a lambda function) and the chain to execute if that condition is met.
    ```python
    branch = RunnableBranch(
        (lambda x: x.sentiment == "Positive", positive_chain),
        (lambda x: x.sentiment == "Negative", negative_chain),
        default_chain  # Fallback chain
    )
    ```
    > 💡 **Tip:** A default branch using `RunnableLambda` can handle cases where no condition is met. `RunnableLambda` converts a standard Python lambda function into a composable Runnable component.

6.  **Form Final Chain**: Connect the classification chain to the branch chain.
    ```python
    final_chain = classification_chain | branch
    ```
7.  **Invoke**: Call `final_chain.invoke()` with the user feedback to trigger the conditional workflow.
